A Semantic MediaWiki extension which adds some extra special properties to all
content pages in a wiki.

You will have to specify (LocalSettings.php) which properties you want to include,
using the array $sespSpecialProperties.

Please note that users that are otherwise hidden to some usergroup might be revealed
by this extension, as the EUSER property will list all authors for everyone.

|Add all users that edited this article (expensive)
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_EUSER';
|-
|_CUSER
|Add user that created this article
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_CUSER'; 
|-
|_REVID
|Add property with current revision ID
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_REVID'; 
|-
|_VIEWS
|Add property with number of page views. Note that depending on local settings this value might
not be very up to date. If $wgDisableCounters is set to true this property will never be set
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_VIEWS'; 
|-
|_NREV
|Add property showing an estimated number of total revisions
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_NREV';  
|-
|_TNREV
|Same but for the talk page, i.e. showing how much discussion is going on around this page
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_TNREV'; 
|-
|_SUBP
|Add properties for subpages
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_SUBP'; 
|-
|_MIMETYPE
|Adding mimetype in case the article object is NS_IMAGE/NS_FILE
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_MIMETYPE'; 
|-
|_MEDIATYPE
|Adding mediatype in case the article object is NS_IMAGE/NS_FILE
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_MEDIATYPE'; 
|-
|_SHORTURL
|Adding short URL if Extension:ShortUrl is installed, and there is a shortened URL for the current page
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_SHORTURL'; 
|-
|_METADATA
|Adding some porperties based om image metadata (exif data), when available
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_METADATA';
|-
|_USERREG
|Adding a property to user pages with the users registration date
|$sespSpecialProperties[] = '_USERREG';
|}

Special Properties compound customizing can be maintained as:
<pre>
$sespSpecialProperties = array( '_EUSER', '_CUSER', '_REVID', '_VIEWS', '_NREV', '_TNREV', '_SUBP',
'_MIMETYPE', '_MEDIATYPE', '_SHORTURL', '_METADATA', '_USERREG' );
</pre>

After upgrading from 0.1 to 0.2 or higher, you will need to run the SMW refresh script for things for work.

To ignore all users with a bot flag when creating the article author properties.
(This does not affect the article creator property.)

<pre>
$wgSESPExcludeBots = true;
</pre>
