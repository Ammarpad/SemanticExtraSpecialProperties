If you would like to make a contribution to [Semantic Extra Special Properties][sesp] (a.k.a. SESP), please ensure that pull requests are based on the current master.

In order to swiftly coordinate a contribution, the following should be provided:
- Definition that complies with the existing `json` file
- Code should be easily read and if necessary be put into separate components (or classes)
- Newly added features should not alter an existing test but instead provide additional test coverage to verify the expected behaviour

For a description on how to write and run PHPUnit test, please consult the [manual][mw-testing].
