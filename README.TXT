This extensions, when used with Semantic MediaWiki, adds some extra special properties to all content pages in the wiki.
You will have to state explicitly in LocalSettings.php which properties you want to include, using the array $smwgPageSpecialProperties2. (Just like with $smwgPageSpecialProperties in recent versions of SMW.)

Please note that users that are otherwise hidden to some usergroup might be revealed by this extension,
as the EUSER property will list all authors for everyone.

Originally written for http://sÃ¤songsmat.nu, this extension works fine for me. It may or may not work for you.
I have only tested the latest version with MW 1.18 and SMW 1.7.

Installation:
=============
Place the extension files in $IP/extensions/SemanticExtraProperties/

Add the following line to LocalSettings.php:
require_once("$IP/extensions/SemanticExtraSpecialProperties/SemanticExtraSpecialProperties.php");

Use $smwgPageSpecialProperties2 in LocalSettings to enable properties offered here, like this:

$smwgPageSpecialProperties2[] = '_EUSER';// Add properties for editiong users
$smwgPageSpecialProperties2[] = '_CUSER';// Add property for creating user
$smwgPageSpecialProperties2[] = '_REVID';// Add property with current revision ID
$smwgPageSpecialProperties2[] = '_VIEWS';// Add property with number of page views. Note that depending on local settings this value might not be very up to date. If $wgDisableCounters is set to true this property will never be set
$smwgPageSpecialProperties2[] = '_NREV'; // Add property showing an estimated number of total revisions
$smwgPageSpecialProperties2[] = '_TNREV';// Same but for the talk page, i.e. showing how much discussion is going on around this page
$smwgPageSpecialProperties2[] = '_SUBP'; // Add properties for subpages

...or to enable them all in one line:
$smwgPageSpecialProperties2 = array( '_EUSER', '_CUSER', '_REVID', '_VIEWS', '_NREV', '_TNREV', '_SUBP' );

After upgrading from 0.1 to 0.2 or higher, you will need to run the SMW refresh script for things for work.

Add the following line to LocalSettings.php to ignore all users with bot flag when creating the article author properties.
(This does not affect the article creator property.)

$wgSESPExcludeBots = true;
